# HOW TO STYLE THE WEBSITE

- Website Styling is handled in 'main.css'
- Website Colors is handled in 'color.css'
- Website layout is handled in 'layout.css'

> WARNING!
    The first class of an element should be their "label" (not the element label). It's just used for identification and for main.css if needed.

## What is considered styling
Size of an element in `px`, text formatting, text styling, font weight, adding shadow and effects, padding and margin, as well as positioning.

## color.css handles all things that is related to coloring the website.
The colors in the website is divided into main, sub, and highlight. It specifically follows the 60-30-10 rule, 60% of main, 30% of sub, and 10% of highlight.

The font color is the opposite of the background color (to make it readable.)

## layout.css uses percentage, it lays out things and its job is to keep things responsive.
Layouts like divided by 3, or divided into 2, or 1 column layout is written there.

## font-size is just there so you can change font-size in html quickly

## buttons
there are button container and the button itself. button container is just to give "size-change" effect.
